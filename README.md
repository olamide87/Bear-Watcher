# Bear-Watcher

## Description 
This project is used to show javascript modules in separate component files.  We used JQuery for the first time when using click events. 
We created a simple bootstrap form that allowed us to input a bear name and url. When the submit button is clicked, those values are pushed into an object and then pushed into an array called Bears. There will be a click event that that triggers a dom string builder function. This will print boot strap cards with the bears picture and name in area will call the 'river'.
